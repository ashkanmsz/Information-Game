This is a game that challenges your general knowledge of names that are included in different categories that begin with a specified letter. In this game, I have implemented a server and client on the local ip and port to simulate the online multiplayer games.
# Features:
1. In this game, you are able to create a profile yourself with a sign-up button or log in to your created profile.
2. Then, you should choose whether you want to host a game or join a game.
3. If you choose to join, you will see a list of players who are waiting to play with you.
4. If you choose to host a game, you should wait until others join you.
5. Finally, there would be a table with a given letter and a timer.
6. You should fill in the blanks with names that begin with that letter.
7. If anyone fills in all the blanks in time, and pushes the stop button he/she will win the game.
# How to run:
Run the **gui.java** file to start the game
